# Teaching-Programming-Portfolio
Hi! I am a fourth year Computer Science major that specializes in machine learning. This is my
teaching programming portfolio for the Fall 2020 quarter. I have 7 years of experience in Java
and 3 years of experience in C/C++. I'm in the process of learning Python as well. I do also
have some experience in MATLAB and R. I also am familiar with working on Linux workstations.
